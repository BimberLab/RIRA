Classify_TNK(

\arguments{
\item{seuratObj}{The seurat object}

\item{assayName}{The name of the assay to use. Others will be dropped}

\item{columnPrefix}{A prefix that will be added to the beginning of the resulting columns, added the seurat@meta.data}

\item{convertAmbiguousToNA}{If true, any values for majority_voting with commas (indicating they are ambiguous) will be converted to NA}

\item{maxAllowableClasses}{Celltypist can assign a cell to many classes, creating extremely long labels. Any cell with more than this number of labels will be set to NA}

\item{minFractionToInclude}{If non-null, any labels with fewer than this fraction of cells will be set to NA.}

\item{minCellsToRun}{If the input seurat object has fewer than this many cells, NAs will be added for all expected columns and celltypist will not be run.}

\item{maxBatchSize}{If more than this many cells are in the object, it will be split into batches of this size and run in serial.}

\item{retainProbabilityMatrix}{If true, the celltypist probability_matrix with per-class probabilities will be stored in meta.data}
}
\description{
Runs celltypist using the RIRA T/NK 4-class model to score cells using CellTypist with optimized parameters.
